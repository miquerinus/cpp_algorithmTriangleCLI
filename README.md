<h2> Details about the algorithm... </h2>

<p>The algorithm is designed to verify the values of the sides of a triangle and, based on their values, to determine the type of triangle.</p>

- The algorithm is written in the C++ language.
- The algorithm uses input and output of data of type integer.
- The algorithm checks each input and, based on the values obtained, provides the user with the output.
- The algorithm is not intended to be very stylized, as it is a basic-level algorithm designed to exercise programming logic and master the main aspects of the C++ language.
- The algorithm is still simple for now, so there may be bugs, which are subject to future corrections/maintenance.

<h2> Future intentions... </h2>

<p> In the future, the algorithm may be modified to draw all sides of the triangle graphically on the screen according to the values passed by the user. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

- As an exercise in logic and practice of the C++ language syntax, this is a great exercise, which could lead to further improvements of the algorithm and the development of other, more complex algorithms.
